Deep within the emerald forest, lay an unkown world of glist and shine. 
A secret kept hidden from the treacheorous greedy hunters, a tiny world of charm amd sparkle.
Their voices, a soft chime on a windy noon; entities as tender and soft as dewdrops on a newborn leaf, thier wings fluttering through the goldlit sun; wherever they went left behind a trail of sparkled golden fairydust.
